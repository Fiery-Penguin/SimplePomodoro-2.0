# Simple Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple pomodoro timer i made simply because i was tired of people overcomplicating pomodoro's and most timers not having a visual aspect to them. A lot of timers out there do fancy things like sessions and shit, but honestly, a good pomodoro just gives you the work time and the resting time and nothing more. I don't want to spend time setting up the perfect pomodoro config to tell me what i should be doing in a given session, i have notes for that, i just wanna get to work. Simple as that

## Dependencies
The script only has a single dependency: `playsound`. Which is used to... you know, play the sound

## Installation
Just `git clone https://github.com/Fiery-Penguin/SimplePomodoro `and `pip install playsound` to get the dependency if it's not already installed and you should be good to go. don't spend too much time on all this, go get some work done

### TO DO
- [x] Center the timer correctly
- [ ] Add option to include or exclude features
- [ ] Add option to only stop playing the sound once user has interacted with the program
